          A comparison An NFT internet The internet today NFTs are digitally
          unique, no two NFTs are the same. A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or
          .jpg, is the same as the original. Every NFT must have an owner and
          this is of public record and easy for anyone to verify. Ownership
          records of digital items are stored on servers controlled by
          institutions â€“ you must take their word for it. NFTs are compatible
          with anything built using Ethereum. An NFT ticket for an event can be
          traded on every Ethereum marketplace, for an entirely different NFT.
          You could trade a piece of art for a ticket! Companies with digital
          items must build their own infrastructure. For example an app that
          issues digital tickets for events would have to build their own ticket
          exchange. Content creators can sell their work anywhere and can access
          a global market. Creators rely on the infrastructure and distribution
          of the platforms they use. These are often subject to terms of use and
          geographical restrictions. Creators can retain ownership rights over
          their own work, and claim resale royalties directly. Platforms, such
          as music streaming services, retain the majority of profits from
          sales. Items can be used in surprising ways. For example, you can use
          digital artwork as collateral in a decentralised loan. NFT examples
          The NFT world is relatively new. In theory, the scope for NFTs is
          anything that is unique that needs provable ownership. Here are some
          examples of NFTs that exist today, to help you get the idea: A unique
          digital artwork A unique sneaker in a limited-run fashion line An
          in-game item An essay.
